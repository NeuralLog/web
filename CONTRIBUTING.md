## Coding Guidelines

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier to enforce a consistent code style. Please ensure your code follows these guidelines:

- Run `npm run lint` to check for style issues.
- Run `npm run format` to automatically fix style issues.

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
- Run tests with `npm test`.

### Documentation

- Update the documentation to reflect any changes.
- Document all public APIs.
- Use JSDoc comments for all public methods and classes.

## Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

Example:
```
feat: add support for authentication
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md or documentation with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. The pull request will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer.
