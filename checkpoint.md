# Puppeteer Project Checkpoint

## 2025-04-01: Initial Plan
- Use Puppeteer to navigate to Reddit
- Capture a screenshot to verify successful navigation
- Document the process and any issues encountered

## Current Status
- Attempted to navigate to Reddit using Puppeteer
- Encountered a network security block (likely Cloudflare protection)
- Successfully captured a screenshot of the block page
- Discovered FlareSolverr in the user's directory, which is a tool designed to bypass Cloudflare and similar protections
- Found the docker-compose.yml for FlareSolverr which shows how to set it up

## Next Steps
- Set up FlareSolverr using Docker Compose
- Use FlareSolverr as a proxy to navigate to Reddit
- Alternatively, try a different website that doesn't have such strict security measures
