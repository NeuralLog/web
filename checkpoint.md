# Puppeteer Project Checkpoint

## 2025-04-01: Initial Plan
- Use Puppeteer to navigate to Reddit
- Capture a screenshot to verify successful navigation
- Document the process and any issues encountered

## Current Status
- Attempted to navigate to Reddit using Puppeteer
- Encountered a network security block (likely Cloudflare protection)
- Successfully captured a screenshot of the block page
- Discovered FlareSolverr in the user's directory, which is a tool designed to bypass Cloudflare and similar protections
- Found the docker-compose.yml for FlareSolverr which shows how to set it up
- Successfully started the FlareSolverr container using Docker Compose
- Successfully used FlareSolverr's API to access Reddit content, but received a large amount of data
- Created scripts to help combine Puppeteer with FlareSolverr
- Successfully navigated to and interacted with alternative websites (example.com and httpbin.org)

## Next Steps
- Create a more direct integration between FlareSolverr and Puppeteer
- Test the FlareSolverr API with specific Reddit endpoints
- Consider using a headless browser approach with Puppeteer that leverages FlareSolverr
