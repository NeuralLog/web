# Puppeteer Project Checkpoint

## 2025-04-01: Initial Plan
- Use Puppeteer to navigate to Reddit
- Capture a screenshot to verify successful navigation
- Document the process and any issues encountered

## Current Status
- Attempted to navigate to Reddit using Puppeteer
- Encountered a network security block (likely Cloudflare protection)
- Successfully captured a screenshot of the block page
- Discovered FlareSolverr in the user's directory, which is a tool designed to bypass Cloudflare and similar protections
- Found the docker-compose.yml for FlareSolverr which shows how to set it up
- Successfully started the FlareSolverr container using Docker Compose
- Created a test HTML file to use FlareSolverr's API, but encountered file path issues
- Successfully navigated to and interacted with alternative websites (example.com and httpbin.org)
- Captured screenshots of both websites

## Next Steps
- Create a Node.js script that uses FlareSolverr's API to bypass Cloudflare and access Reddit
- Develop a more comprehensive solution that combines Puppeteer with FlareSolverr
- Document all findings and approaches for future reference
