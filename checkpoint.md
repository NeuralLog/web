# Puppeteer Project Checkpoint

## 2025-04-01: Initial Plan
- Use Puppeteer to navigate to Reddit
- Capture a screenshot to verify successful navigation
- Document the process and any issues encountered

## Current Status
- Attempted to navigate to Reddit using Puppeteer
- Encountered a network security block (likely Cloudflare protection)
- Successfully captured a screenshot of the block page
- Discovered FlareSolverr in the user's directory, which is a tool designed to bypass Cloudflare and similar protections
- Found the docker-compose.yml for FlareSolverr which shows how to set it up
- Successfully started the FlareSolverr container using Docker Compose
- Successfully used FlareSolverr's API to access Reddit content, but received a large amount of data
- Created scripts to help combine Puppeteer with FlareSolverr
- Successfully navigated to and interacted with alternative websites (example.com and httpbin.org)
- Created two login scripts for Reddit:
  - A basic Puppeteer login script (reddit_login.js)
  - An enhanced script that uses FlareSolverr to bypass Cloudflare (reddit_login_flaresolverr.js)
- Set up a secure credential storage solution using JSON files

## Next Steps
- Update the reddit_credentials.json file with actual login information
- Run the login scripts to test access to Reddit
- Extend the scripts to perform specific actions once logged in
- Implement error handling for various login scenarios
- Create a more comprehensive solution with session persistence
